# IPASS-PCA9685
IPASS repository for my library for the PCA9685 pwm driver controller chip

For the application i used a 4dof (4 degrees of freedom) robot arm.
There are a lot of them you can buy but i recommend one with metal 
gear servos wich can handle the rotations and weight of the arm. 
Those with metal gear servos are pricier though.

Here is one: https://www.dennisdeal.com/products/4dof-assembling-acrylic-mechine-robot-arm-with-mg90-metal-gear-servo-for-robot-diy
The chip the library is writen for is the PCA9685 from adafruit. part of my library is based on their code but writen so that it works together with hwlib from the user Wovo ( https://github.com/wovo/hwlib )
