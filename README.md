# Adafruit PCA9685 Library
IPASS repository for my library for the PCA9685 pwm driver controller chip

For the application i used a 4dof (4 degrees of freedom) robot arm.
There are a lot of them you can buy but i recommend one with metal 
gear servos wich can handle the rotations and weight of the arm. 
Those with metal gear servos are pricier though.

Here is one:

The chip the library is writen for is the PCA9685 from adafruit ( https://www.adafruit.com/product/815 ). 
Part of my library is based on their code, but writen so that it works together with hwlib from the github-user Wovo 
( https://github.com/wovo/hwlib )
